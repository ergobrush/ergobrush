Description:
Ergobrush is a hand held gimbal-style device that provides three axis of rotation. This allows the user to achieve all desired angles to fully brush their teeth without necessitating the movement of their hand. Our device is designed to provide independence to individuals with hand mobility constraints when brushing their teeth.
